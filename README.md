# Getting started
## Project description
The aim of this project of Machine Learning do some early detection and prevention MICHD diseases. The goal is to estimate the likelihood of developing MICHD given a certain clinical and lifestyle situation.
The model is based on a vector of features collecting the health-related data of a person.
We preprocess and train the dataset on 6 different regression models using cross validation methods to tune hyperparameters. and we assess which one gives the best f1 score to give the best prediction.

More details about the project are available in `project1_description.pdf`.
## Data
The data that you we used comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a system of
health-related telephone surveys that collects state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk
behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. In particular, respondents were classified
as having coronary heart disease (MICHD) if they reported having been told by a provider they had MICHD.
Respondents were also classified as having MICHD if they reported having been told they had a heart attack (i.e.,
myocardial infarction) or angina.
 The dataset is available at https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-project-1/dataset_files. To reproduce the results the files should be added to the repo, as described in [Repo Architecture](#repo-architecture). A detailed description of the dataset is available in 'https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2015.html'.

## Report
All the details about the choices that have been made and the methodology used throughout this project are available in `report.pdf`. In this report, the different asumptions, decisions and results made and found are explained.
# Reproduce results
The results have been produced on a Anaconda Prompt terminal with version ...

- Download the folder Project1submission.zip
- Extract the folder Project1submission from the zip
- Open your terminal
- cd path_to_folder_Project1submission
- If the defaults environnment is not activated type conda activate
- execute python run.py
- A file called 'submission' has been created with the required format

## Requirements
- Python==3.9.13
- Numpy==1.21.5
- Matplotlib

## Instructions to run 
Move to the root folder and execute:

    python run.py

Make sure to have all the requirements and the data files are in the root. 

# Results
The performances of the model is assessed on AirCrowd from `data/submission.csv` generated by `run.py`. The model achieves a global accuracy of "0.837" with a F1-score of "0.3910" the submission ID on AIcrowd is 243811.
